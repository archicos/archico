                            Most Outstanding Student of IT Del. Yes... that title has always been ringing in my head for a long time. It's something
                            I've dreamed of for a long time, because it started with a senior high school figure who was suddenly reported to have
                            won the title of Most Outstanding Student of ITS Surabaya. Participating in various activities, being active in various organizations, trying everything that is sometimes even very far from the limits of
                            one's abilities.
                            <br><br>
                            Until that day arrived, it turned out that my name appeared as one of the six selected candidates. I felt very happy to
                            be able to touch that point, after previously being pessimistic and having given up hope. So in that one night, I
                            reached out to everyone I could reach to be able to give me the voting rights they had. However, it turned out that
                            these efforts were insignificant compared to other candidates who were much better known than me, who was only known to
                            two or three people around me.

                            Happy Birthday, Big Bro!
                            After you talked a lot about what it was like to be the first child, how hard it was for the two of you to support each
                            other with such a heavy family burden, as the first child, that's how I salute you. So I can feel what you feel, because
                            I can also relate to myself too hahaha. There's a close friend of mine, he's also the first child, hahaha, he's
                            stubborn, like the older ones, but he's also tough like the first child, only the difference is that they're a little
                            more affluent than us, so it's not like you're the one who has to take responsibility for your parents and younger
                            siblings, he's just enough. He can only bear himself, but even then he is still often down, maybe he hasn't been used to
                            it since he was little, in his family, things are smooth and well-off, unlike those of us who have been bitter since we
                            were small, we have felt our shortcomings... but yes, that's how's life works....

                            Today is exactly 2 years since the announcement for Chic :) I can't believe it, it's been 2 years....does it feel like
                            it? Hahaha. actually it feels like it was 10 years ago, but it turns out it's still 2 years :) how about it? is it
                            comfortable? is there anything you still regret? So far, it's just comfortable, okay? :) But I don't know whether if you
                            go to ITB it will be even more comfortable... but yes, it could be that it's going to be damaged for us :) Bandung is as

                            the new canteen :) about being grateful for what you've experienced...
                            I'll just talk about that, I feel like we've started to find what we've been looking for all this time "what do you get
                            from del?", well, I don't know if the answer is that woman :) but whatever it is I hope we're grateful, chic :) you're
                            the one who taught us Let's be grateful :) How happy does it feel to have him in our lives :) I hope we can not
                            disappoint him, at least it's limited to making him comfortable with us :) If we can, make him happy forever :)

                            I'm relieved that I'm finally done with all of this, phew, what a relief, I haven't felt calm this week, I've been
                            suffocating, I've been scared, I've had cold sweats, I've neglected my homework, abandoned trips, abandoned projects,
                            the Department of Communication and Communication has not been taken care of, I'm sorry even my beloved became a brntm
                            because of this😠
                            
                            It's a lesson, cool, next time don't just list something, prepare everything, overall you won't lose, that's adding
                            experience, even though we were already checkmated until we were speechless HAHAHA, got mental brooo:""" What mom said
                            is true, We are still lacking in communication, speaking and English, it's true what you said, we have a lot of things
                            in our heads, but it's hard to convey them through words, and it's also a matter of being nervous:""
                            
                            yeah, that's what happens if you're an introvert but trying to break ma heart break ma hafff, just kid:" but trying to
                            break ur comfort zone to be good at communicating in public :) I hope we keep getting used to it, don't miss it please

                            Today was the first time I met and got to know my beautiful family, COIL'15 and COIL'17...
                            It's like when we met earlier, it turned out they were fun, cool, funny, and tough too... We all loved it... So I was
                            thinking, why do I have to change this coil to my little brother... But I don't know. I'm sure I'm right or wrong. BTW,
                            my older brother was chosen to be a BPH coil 🤣🤣 Because he said that of all of us, the only older brother is the one
                            who is stubborn :v Only the older brother has the courage to chat with everyone ha ha ha ha ha ha ha I hope I'll get
                            married later, I don't know who, bro :v We're all invited, at least take a photo from top to bottom ha ha ha ha, I don't
